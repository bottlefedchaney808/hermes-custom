# Hermes adaptation — receiving-code-review

This skill's SKILL.md is runtime-agnostic; on Hermes the actions it names
resolve to these tools. The full mapping lives in [../using-superpowers/references/hermes-tools.md](../using-superpowers/references/hermes-tools.md).

| Action this skill uses | Hermes equivalent |
|---|---|
| Grep the codebase for actual usage (YAGNI check) | `search_files` with `target: "content"` |
| Test each fix | `terminal` |

## Model / subagent-type note

Hermes children inherit the parent model — there is no per-call model name,
no `model:`, and no `subagent_type`. Any model-pinning in the original skill
does not apply and is ignored on Hermes.
